- Controllers:
  - Validate request body, query and params with Zod DTOs.
  - Call services only (no DB/Redis directly).
  - Use `res.sendResponse()` for responses.

- Services:
  - Contain all business logic.
  - Throw `ApiError` with `HTTP_STATUS` for errors.
  - Return standardized response objects.
