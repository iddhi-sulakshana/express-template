- Always use `./scripts/server.sh` to manage backend and database services.
- Available commands:
  - `./scripts/server.sh start` → Start backend + databases in the docker
  - `./scripts/server.sh start-db` → Start only databases
  - `./scripts/server.sh stop` → Stop all services
  - `./scripts/server.sh restart` → Restart services
  - `./scripts/server.sh logs` → Show backend logs
  - `./scripts/server.sh build` → Build/rebuild backend
  - `./scripts/server.sh status` → Show container/service status
  - `./scripts/server.sh clean` → Clean up containers and volumes
- If not using then use the `bun run dev` to start the backend
- Do not run raw `docker compose` or `bun` commands for these tasks — always use the script.
