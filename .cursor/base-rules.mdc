🚨 Critical Restrictions

- All source code must live inside `src/`.
- Config file changes require owner approval.
- No direct DB queries outside repositories.

✅ Required Practices

- Always use barrel files for exports.
- Use enums in DB schema when possible.
- Wrap risky logic in try/catch with proper ApiError handling.
- Follow established module structure.
